Machine Learning Final Project
======

This is my machine learning final project. I figured I'd throw it up here because why not.

It's meant to be a cryptocurrency pricing model for the BTC-ETH market on Coinbase.

Although currently it basically just scrapes data into an SQLite database...

If anyone wants to use this, open an issue or something to let me know!
